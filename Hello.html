<article> SEX EDUCATION: Mind it "MALE Sex Education" This article I'm writing is about male sex education. Like many of you may have heard this world for the time. It just seems that nothing like this just exists. No one raises the question HOW THE HELL?/do the males then get to know about the things??By discussing among friends, who are all nearly at the same maturity level, all new to it. All got a new toy giving complete new Evil Pleasure.    </article>
